Hi love again here we are ...

with lots of questions and answeres of my wicked heart. First of first i just want to say thanks to you  for listening me so calmly and quitely . 

Today my feeling was more inclined towards Anger. Most of the time i was angry on people, people those who i love and i don't know why. sometimes i just think that it's my fault that i behave like this and sometime i think it's them who make me to do things in this way. It's crazy that how you can be most chillist person and still people have something to say behind your back..

Last night when we were plying i said some thing in frustration that i should'n had to say i mean there was no need to say thing like this to someone espacially when he is your Homie.

Good thing is, i realised what i did and i said sorry this morning to my friend who is good. but in these situation why i am the who have face this cause people think i am weak? 

To be Hosnest i really think that people in this world are so sick that they cannot even think about someone else and always try to release thier frustration on ohers. 

I just don't want to be like them i just want be kind, peaceful so i don't know what to do ,,,,,


so that's all for tody my love ....GD byeeee.
