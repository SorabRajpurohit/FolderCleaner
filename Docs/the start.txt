hello my name is saurabh and i'm here to tell you the story about my life ---

so listen closely cause it might teach you about you life and incidents that are already happening or going to happen in neat future.

everything what we see in this life and in this thing which we call world is just a myth i guess and i don't know why i'm talking this way but
 
it is what it is. 

problem is that why i'm not there where i exectly wanted to be i mean i did all the things to make myself perfect in manner of physique, mental, 

finacial is not exactly but yes!!, and spiritual offcourse and yet i wonder why i can't be able to reach there. 

in terms of love, sucess, God, family i'm just continuing to fail my loved ones. I wonder what i suppose to do to make my dreams came true.

I know if i go with blessing with mahadev i will surely get succed but is it really make me happy just for ones in my life i want to get succeed 

by my own. I Just Want to feel that pride, that joy.

Just for once i want a girl who always stay by my side on every situation i'm so tired to be alone in this wicked world i want someone who can 

complete me like pice a of a puzzle. where are you? are feeling the same what i'm feeling this viod of with numbness. 

i have a lovely family, friends with a golden heart and best Relatives i don't have anything to complain about but i can't help it that i want 

more of a kind of love.

I love my Bhagwan but i want something to proove and share this success with my loved ones.... othewise it's all doesn't make any sanse. I will do 

everything to achive everything what i want in my life and i promise to you that one day, maybe not today, maybe not tommorow but one day i will 

get what is deserve with kripa of my Bhagwan shiv. so , this is itt for today we will meet tommorow whith some lucid dreams,,, love!
